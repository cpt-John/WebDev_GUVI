Problem Statement :

to log in with the details provided during registration
Successful login should redirect to a profile page which should
contain additional details such as age,dob,contact, etc
that can be updated by the user
Points to remember :
Html, CSS, JavaScript, PHP should be in separate files.
CSS should be written using sass/scss. The project should
contain both scss file and compiled css file.
The form submission should be handled using ajax, do not use
HTML form action. Use bootstrap to make page responsive

be in SVG format Use jQuery to simplify dom manipulations.
